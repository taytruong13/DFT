# Built-In Self-Test (BIST) Projects for DFT Practice

This repository contains 5 practical exercises aimed at demonstrating the principles of **Design-for-Testability (DFT)** at the RTL (Register Transfer Level) and showcasing the use of **Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)** and **Multiple Input Signature Register (MISR)** in BIST applications.

Through these projects, I aim to showcase my skills in RTL design, Verilog coding, and testbench development, as well as my understanding of critical concepts in DFT.

## Overview

Built-In Self-Test (BIST) is a key technique in **Design-for-Testability (DFT)** that allows integrated circuits to test themselves without the need for external testing equipment. This repository explores fundamental concepts of BIST, such as:

- Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)
- Random pattern generation
- Signature compression using Multiple Input Signature Register (MISR)
- Fault detection through signature comparison

Each project in this repository is self-contained and designed to be practical, allowing hands-on experience with both Verilog coding and testbench development.
