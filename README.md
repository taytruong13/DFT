# DFT (Design-for-Testability) Portfolio

Welcome to my **DFT (Design-for-Testability or Design-for-Test)** portfolio repository! This repository showcases my practical projects and exercises in DFT, focusing on RTL (Register Transfer Level) implementations of essential techniques such as **Scan Chain** and **Built-In Self-Test (BIST)**.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my technical skills, problem-solving capabilities, and passion for **RTL Design** and **DFT**. It also serves as a resource for learning and exploring key concepts in DFT.
