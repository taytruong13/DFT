# DFT Scan Chain Practice

This repository contains a series of RTL Verilog designs and testbenches for practicing **Design-for-Testability (DFT)** with a focus on implementing **scan chains**. The projects progress from simple designs like D flip-flops to more complex systems like FSMs. Each module is accompanied by detailed specifications and testbenches to verify functionality.

## **Contents**
1. **D Flip-Flop with Scan Chain**
   - A basic D flip-flop enhanced with scan chain functionality.
2. **4-bit Shift Register with Scan Chain**
   - A shift register supporting scan input and scan output.
3. **8-bit Counter with Scan Chain**
   - A synchronous counter with state monitoring via scan chain.
4. **4-bit ALU with Scan Chain**
   - An arithmetic logic unit with scan chain for functional testing.
5. **Finite State Machine (FSM) with Scan Chain**
   - A 3-state FSM capable of state verification through scan chain.
